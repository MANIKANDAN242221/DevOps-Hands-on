🚀 OpenVPN Installation Guide

This guide walks you through the installation and configuration of OpenVPN Access Server on an AWS EC2 instance within a custom VPC.

⚙️ Prerequisites

AWS account with permissions to create VPC, subnets, EC2 instances, and security groups

Set up a VPC with the following configuration:

VPC: 1

Public Subnets: 2 🌐

Private Subnets: 2 🔒

Internet Gateway (IGW): 1

NAT Gateway: 1

Ensure your route tables are configured correctly so that public subnets can access the Internet via IGW and private subnets via NAT.

💻 Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance

Launch a public EC2 instance in one of the public subnets.

Assign a public IP to the instance for remote access 🌍.

Connect to the instance via SSH 🔑.

🛠️ Step 3: Install OpenVPN Access Server

Run the following commands to update your instance and install OpenVPN Access Server:

sudo apt update
sudo bash -c 'bash <(curl -fsS https://packages.openvpn.net/as/install.sh) --yes'


This installs OpenVPN Access Server from the official OpenVPN repository ✅.

📄 Step 4: Verify Installation
